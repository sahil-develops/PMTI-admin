        <h1>Understanding SAFe Framework: A Comprehensive Guide</h1>
        
        <p>The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is a set of organization and workflow patterns intended to guide enterprises in scaling lean and agile practices. This guide will help you understand the key concepts and implementation strategies.</p>
        
        <h2>What is SAFe?</h2>
        <p>SAFe is a knowledge base of proven, integrated principles and practices for Lean, Agile, and DevOps. It provides guidance for work at the Portfolio, Large Solution, Program, and Team levels.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Benefits of SAFe</h2>
        <p>SAFe offers several advantages for large organizations looking to scale their Agile practices effectively.</p>

                    <p><strong>Scrum</strong> is an Agile framework designed for individual teams, typically consisting of 5–10 members. It emphasizes iterative development, frequent feedback, and continuous improvement within a single team.</p>
                    <p><strong>SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)</strong>, on the other hand, is designed to scale Agile practices across multiple teams, departments, and even entire enterprises. SAFe introduces additional layers such as <strong>Agile Release Trains (ARTs)</strong>, <strong>Lean Portfolio Management</strong>, and <strong>Program Increments (PIs)</strong> to ensure strategic alignment and smooth execution across large-scale projects.</p>
                    <p><em>Use Scrum for small team agility and SAFe when coordinating multiple Agile teams across an organization.</em></p>

                    <p>SAFe implementation timelines vary depending on the organization's size, complexity, and level of Agile maturity.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Small and mid-sized organizations:</strong> Typically 6–12 months to see measurable improvements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Large enterprises:</strong> May take 12–24 months to fully integrate SAFe across multiple teams and departments.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Successful adoption involves structured <strong>PI Planning</strong>, leadership training, and ongoing coaching. Organizations often start by piloting SAFe within a few Agile teams before scaling across the entire enterprise.</p>
